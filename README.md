# Canvas UI

**For the Future.**

I created this Canvas for future development. Targeting desktop applications (All Platforms).

Canvas UI is powered by the beautiful [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron). Using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for UI and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for creating the "bottleneck"


## Get Started
Step 1 - `git clone`
Step 2 - `cd canvas-ui`
Step 3 - `npm install`
Step 4 - `npm run watch` or `npm run build`
Step 5 - `electron .` or `npm run start`
